At ImpactMe, we envision a world where no individual is deprivedof access to education and the opportunity to earn a livelihood. We believe that education is the most powerful tool that can be used to break the cycle of poverty, and our mission is to make it accessible to all, regardless of their socio-economic background.

## About Project


<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98155526/228359958-adb2a077-769f-4444-8c59-d8ebf4598c98.png" width=350 height=350 align="center"></p>


With our cutting-edge app, we aim to provide a gateway to vocational courses for the underprivileged residing in cities, remote areas, and slums. We understand that the lack of access to quality education and skill-building opportunities often leads to unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion. Hence, we have developed a platform that connects volunteers possessing various skills to work in different regions, teaching different skills for varying durations throughout the year. In addition to providing vocational courses, we also aim to offer other essential resources such as, donated books, food, and other necessities to individuals in need. We envision a world where every individual has access to quality vocational education and the opportunity to pursue their dreams. Join us in making a positive impact and realizing our shared vision through the ImpactMe app.

# Sustainable Development Goals targeted by us
</br>

<b> 1. No Poverty </b>

* With the existential recurrence of poverty around the world, we aimed to bridge the gaps of opportunities and resources that are prevalent within the society</br>

* The ambition of the young minds and their desire to reestablish their position in the society certainly inspired us.</br>

* We are targeting No Poverty by providing them a vocational training platform by which they learn something new and supplement their present incomes or come up with good business plans.</br>



<b> 2. Zero Hunger </b>

* The direct linkage of poverty with hunger is well understood and we felt that addressing such issues is the need of the hour to provide their families with basic amenities for living.

* The direct linkage of poverty with hunger is well understood and we felt that addressing such issues is the need of the hour to provide their families with basic amenities for living.



<b> 3. Quality Education </b>

* Seeing their willingness to learn something new certainly inspired us to cater their desires and fulfill their dreams by means of education.

* Educating a person would help in rebuilding the personality and equipping the individual with problem solving capabilities.

* Providing them with the right education so that they can create a stable livelihood for their families was something that drove us in building this application.


<b> 4. Gender Equality and Women‚Äôs Empowerment </b>

* Gender inequality is a prevalent issue that has been ingrained into our societies and hence addressing these issues becomes a priority.

* Promotional content of locally grown businesses will be advertised on our platform and women can take up training to enhance their present skillset and start a new small scale business.  

* Moreover, we would assist them in connecting them to the rightful authorities to help them grow their business. Thus, enabling them with a strong source of income and directly contributing to their family‚Äôs income. 



<b> 5. Reduced Inequalities </b>

* As a result of inequitable resource distribution, poverty has widened the gap between wealthy and poor. Because of inequality, poor people often face discrimination, stigma, and negative social stereotypes that limit their social participation, employment opportunities, and political support.

* With our application, we will assist those in need while preserving existing resources. In addition, instilling hope in them by informing them about the various schemes and opportunities offered by the government will encourage them to lead a better life. Participation in quests will also enliven social inequality. Having them publicly indulged will disintegrate the intersection of poverty and inequality.



<b> 6. Decent Work And Economic Growth </b>

* In our mission, we are supporting small businesses as well as training people so that they are capable of employment in different strata of societies and increase their net income. Thus, we are contributing to the goal of decent work and economic growth.


<b> 7. Partnerships </b>

* We aim to partner with the locally ingrown businesses by providing them a platform for promotion and also advertising different job opportunities within the market so that young minds that are trained via our application can be employed and make gains in their net income significantly.
