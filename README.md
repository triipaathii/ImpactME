At ImpactMe, we envision a world where no individual is deprivedof access to education and the opportunity to earn a livelihood. We believe that education is the most powerful tool that can be used to break the cycle of poverty, and our mission is to make it accessible to all, regardless of their socio-economic background.

## About Project


<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98155526/228359958-adb2a077-769f-4444-8c59-d8ebf4598c98.png" width=350 height=350 align="center"></p>


With our cutting-edge app, we aim to provide a gateway to vocational courses for the underprivileged residing in cities, remote areas, and slums. We understand that the lack of access to quality education and skill-building opportunities often leads to unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion. Hence, we have developed a platform that connects volunteers possessing various skills to work in different regions, teaching different skills for varying durations throughout the year. In addition to providing vocational courses, we also aim to offer other essential resources such as, donated books, food, and other necessities to individuals in need. We envision a world where every individual has access to quality vocational education and the opportunity to pursue their dreams. Join us in making a positive impact and realizing our shared vision through the ImpactMe app.

# Sustainable Development Goals targeted by us
</br>

<b> 1. No Poverty </b>

* With the existential recurrence of poverty around the world, we aimed to bridge the gaps of opportunities and resources that are prevalent within the society</br>

* The ambition of the young minds and their desire to reestablish their position in the society certainly inspired us.</br>

* We are targeting No Poverty by providing them a vocational training platform by which they learn something new and supplement their present incomes or come up with good business plans.</br>



<b> 2. Zero Hunger </b>

* The direct linkage of poverty with hunger is well understood and we felt that addressing such issues is the need of the hour to provide their families with basic amenities for living.

* The direct linkage of poverty with hunger is well understood and we felt that addressing such issues is the need of the hour to provide their families with basic amenities for living.



<b> 3. Quality Education </b>

* Seeing their willingness to learn something new certainly inspired us to cater their desires and fulfill their dreams by means of education.

* Educating a person would help in rebuilding the personality and equipping the individual with problem solving capabilities.

* Providing them with the right education so that they can create a stable livelihood for their families was something that drove us in building this application.


<b> 4. Gender Equality and Women‚Äôs Empowerment </b>

* Gender inequality is a prevalent issue that has been ingrained into our societies and hence addressing these issues becomes a priority.

* Promotional content of locally grown businesses will be advertised on our platform and women can take up training to enhance their present skillset and start a new small scale business.  

* Moreover, we would assist them in connecting them to the rightful authorities to help them grow their business. Thus, enabling them with a strong source of income and directly contributing to their family‚Äôs income. 



<b> 5. Reduced Inequalities </b>

* As a result of inequitable resource distribution, poverty has widened the gap between wealthy and poor. Because of inequality, poor people often face discrimination, stigma, and negative social stereotypes that limit their social participation, employment opportunities, and political support.

* With our application, we will assist those in need while preserving existing resources. In addition, instilling hope in them by informing them about the various schemes and opportunities offered by the government will encourage them to lead a better life. Participation in quests will also enliven social inequality. Having them publicly indulged will disintegrate the intersection of poverty and inequality.



<b> 6. Decent Work And Economic Growth </b>

* In our mission, we are supporting small businesses as well as training people so that they are capable of employment in different strata of societies and increase their net income. Thus, we are contributing to the goal of decent work and economic growth.


<b> 7. Partnerships </b>

* We aim to partner with the locally ingrown businesses by providing them a platform for promotion and also advertising different job opportunities within the market so that young minds that are trained via our application can be employed and make gains in their net income significantly.

## üìå Workflow
The application works on three profile roles namely volunteer, food chains and individual donations. Each part is interrelated and dependent on the other for attaining the goals of the project.</br>

<b> 1. Volunteer </b> </br>
Volunteers play an important role in facilitating donations, in the sense that they transfer donations from donors and food chains to those in need. It is their responsibility to reserve meals and donation items, pick them up at a specific time, and donate them to the needy. In addition, they can organize a campaign named quest to raise awareness, and educate marginalized groups.

<b> 2. Food Chains(organisations) </b> </br>
Many restaurants, hotels, and food chains in the city will be taking care of food donations. Through our application, customers at food chains can order a meal suited to their budget along with their meals. The database of restaurants will be updated with meals and the addition of meals will take place cumulatively. When volunteers book meals, restaurants have to make meals available at the time specified. In addition to this, government organizations and healthcare centres are also able to donate healthcare aids and other necessities through this application by registering as Individual Donors.

<b> 3. Individual Donors </b> </br>
They are groups of generous donors who wish to donate items such as books and clothes.Donor need only to post a donation with a description and an image of the item, set up a pickup time, and the volunteer will pick up donation at their doorstep. 

## üéØ Usuage and Functionality of Feed The Need

### 4. Profile Activity
This activity displays all the necessary details of a user, including their name, contact information, location, and role. As part of the volunteer profile, volunteer points have also been added to reward volunteers with happy meals. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159899948-202ba555-0470-48c5-98aa-48f7d19305bf.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159899312-b2f869fd-4f85-496a-a138-8bb7046d14f8.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159904959-f7110fea-955c-4b47-b63a-71397ab491af.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

### 5. Feed Activity
The activity will allow users to view contributions made by themselves and other members of the community. Additionally, it will highlight other quests and donations near their location. The button of praise has been added so that people can show appreciation for their efforts. Furthermore, volunteers can also showcase their donations on various social media platforms.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159064807-3892af5d-3e05-4a18-a9c3-9664031db522.jpeg" width=250 height=500>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159864286-3e44fc31-ac0a-43d6-bd9d-192819aa87d1.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


‚úèÔ∏è These activities will be common for all three roles, apart from these other essential activities in the application based on the role have been mentioned below: 

## üìå  Individual Donors 
### I) Add Donation 
The donor can add items they wish to donate. Donors need to provide a description, a title, and an image of the item they are donating along with a suitable pick-up time.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823398-525b9bb3-3559-4485-88cd-9355d4ac6e43.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159884507-d104b892-ad66-44cf-a7d0-5ff28ad774cb.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


### II) Donation Status
Donors have the option to oversee donations made by them via status - booked, posted, and distributed. In this activity, they can view the card views of volunteers and their information. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823646-94e45e9c-f167-469c-8c1f-1af2eb57e758.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


## üìå Food Chains
### I)Meal Information
Food chains are supposed to add descriptions and images of meals they wish to provide. Booking meals through POS is only possible once the meal details have been added.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159895220-e6ecb84c-b7f0-4797-a1c3-27ef2dbce76c.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>

### II) Point of Sale(exclusively for users)
The interface allows the public to order a meal for the needy from the food chain. The number of meals they can book is not limited; additionally, their name and contact information is required for records. This interface will also reflect the donation meal provided by the restaurant.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159894081-4a754bd9-95ee-475d-8689-109902631005.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159823875-ff27ca6c-35fb-4095-a3f9-ff2295acb531.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>

‚úèÔ∏èTo make the process of food donation more transparent, we designed POS so that donors can see the description of meals they are donating at food chains. 

### III) Status of Donation
As a way of ensuring donations reach the right people, restaurant/food chains will keep a record of volunteers in the form of card views and information until the donation is completely verified.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824259-8bd3c99f-44ea-485a-8124-e460998f087b.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

## üìå Volunteers
### I) Advertisement for Individual Donations
The goal of this activity is to bring to their attention all the donations (clothes, household items, etc.) that are available near them and should be donated as soon as possible. A volunteer may choose to donate at pickup time.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159827085-2a8d0974-6e5a-4ab1-8a85-74c6ef51b52c.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align="center"></p>



### II) Information to book Meals
From booking to verification, this activity will be a complete food donation activity. Foremost volunteers are supposed to click on an additional component at the bottom right corner of the activity page.

‚úèÔ∏è This part of the application is divided majorly into four parts- <br>

<b> 1. List of Food Chains </b><br>
In this section, volunteers can access a list of food chains in the form of card views and choose any chain that best meets their needs, such as segveral meals and nearby locations.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159892828-b89d4a8b-39c5-41d3-8c02-ae1d4d366330.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


<b> 2. Booking of Meal </b><br>
Volunteers need to book meals by specifying the number of meals they require and the pickup time. Volunteers must always order fewer meals than the total available through the food chain.
 
<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824635-f75ce7c2-d567-44b6-888f-defcca8f9f54.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159824705-d8452be0-657a-4d34-b695-050d1f6f0c07.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

<b> 3. Staus of Meal </b><br>
This activity will specify the status of the meal from the time of Pick Up until it is verified. Four associated statuses include-
* Booked: Meal is booked but not picked from the food chain
* Picked: Time-span from Pick Up time to verify
* Verified: Complete successful donation
* Cancelled: Due to some cause meal is cancelled from the food chain.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159064468-2f561013-d698-463a-99cf-cba27fad8536.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>

<b> 4. Verification </b><br>
Authentication takes place at this point in the application. A volunteer has to upload a picture that has both a donation and a needy person in one frame, and face recognition will be done by machine learning (ML). The number of donations uploaded must match the number of images uploaded. Volunteers can also share and flaunt their donations on social media handles.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159866023-f4d51ef9-bd78-465c-9079-4c5c42c36968.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57085508/159864152-c9a558e7-3d10-4e49-8a02-5d10af91d25b.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>
 
### III) Quest Activity
This is an initiative raised by volunteers for extra-social activities that involve educating children, distributing items, or bringing awareness to social issues. Volunteers can raise a quest anytime through a quest fragment in navigation.

‚úèÔ∏è Quest activity is divided into 3 subparts - <br>

<b> 1. Add Quest Activity </b><br>
By adding details like the date and location of the quest, the number of volunteers required with aim of the quest they can post a quest. The volunteer who raises a quest directly is posted as a lead volunteer.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159828106-7c43ec87-d713-4903-bbb8-8171ad150473.jpeg" width=250 height=500 align=></p>

<b> 2. Lead Volunteer Activity </b><br>
When a volunteer posts a quest, details such as its location, goal, and date will appear in their quest activity. Note that a volunteer can raise only one quest at a time.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/170709241-08d06522-39aa-4c75-b82f-9b80fc4912a3.jpeg" width=250 height=500></p>


<b> 3. Participating Volunteer </b><br>
If volunteers do not raise a quest, the advertisement for other quests will be displayed here as a card view, and volunteers can choose to participate in any quest. They have to comment on their aim of participation to be part of the quest.

<p  align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/170711518-e3cf718d-49f7-4597-8c77-849d4ff69856.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159830110-ebea58f9-efe5-4d09-be33-474bc1c57122.jpeg" width=250 height=500>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77115663/159830238-437d14e3-7a4a-4283-96ee-0759c4d9ace3.jpeg"  width=250 height=500></p>
